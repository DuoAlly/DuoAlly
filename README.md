**DuoAlly** is a generative AI companion designed to enhance the solo gaming experience across genres like action, adventure, role-playing, horror, and puzzle games. DuoAlly acts as a trusted "duo" or "ally" in real-time, providing support, guidance, and companionship throughout single-player games.

## Project Vision

DuoAlly was created to fill a gap in the single-player gaming experience by providing players with a friendly, intelligent companion that responds to and understands game events. DuoAlly brings interactivity and a sense of companionship to solo gaming, whether by lightening tense moments in horror games, brainstorming in puzzle games, or providing tactical insights in action and RPG games.

The AI currently functions as an in-game chatbot that follows and reacts to game events, with potential for future developments to make it a fully animated, voice-enabled assistant that grows along with the player.

## Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: DuoAlly monitors game events and provides relevant feedback, guidance, and banter.
- **Adaptable for Different Genres**: Tailored responses for various game genres (e.g., horror, puzzle, RPG).
- **Knowledge-Based AI**: DuoAlly uses retrieval-augmented generation with knowledge graphs, making it contextually aware and able to understand and enhance the game narrative.
- **Player-Centric Support**: Acts as a brainstorming partner, stress-reliever, or ally depending on gameplay needs.

## Installation

DuoAlly is currently in early development, and installation instructions will be provided in future updates. For now, users with proprietary access may explore the initial codebase by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DuoAlly.git
cd DuoAlly
```

> **Note**: This codebase is proprietary and closed-source. Only authorized users with access to this repository may use it.

## Usage

Once installed, DuoAlly can be launched for integration with single-player games. Currently, it supports text-based interaction, so you can test its features in development mode via command-line or a UI.

1. **Launch DuoAlly** from the command line.
2. **Choose Game Mode** for a genre that best matches your game.
3. **Begin Interaction**: DuoAlly will respond to game events, providing feedback, advice, or friendly dialogue as the game unfolds.

As DuoAlly develops, more detailed usage instructions and compatibility guidelines will be provided.

## Development Status

DuoAlly is in early-stage development, with daily work from a team of four focused on refining core functionality and contextual accuracy. Notable milestones include:

- **Published Collaborative Paper**: An exploration of chatbot accuracy improvement via knowledge graphs in retrieval-augmented generation.
- **Prototype Chatbot Functionalities**: DuoAlly currently tracks basic game events and provides contextual responses.

## Future Plans

1. **Voice and Animation Capabilities**: Progressing from a chatbot to a fully animated, voiced AI companion.
2. **Advanced AI and Machine Learning**: Implementing reinforcement learning techniques like EfficientZero V2 to enhance DuoAlly’s interactive learning from player feedback.
3. **Genre-Specific Personalization**: Customizing DuoAlly’s personality and responses based on the game genre to improve immersion.
4. **Hardware Optimization**: Optimizing DuoAlly to run smoothly on common gaming hardware configurations.
